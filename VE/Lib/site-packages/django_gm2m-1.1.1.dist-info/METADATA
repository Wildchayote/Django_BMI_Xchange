django-gm2m
===========

|copyright| 2014-2020 Thomas Khyn

Django generic many-to-many field implementation.

This django application exposes a ``GM2MField`` that combines
the features of the standard Django ``ManyToManyField`` and
``GenericForeighKey`` and that can be used exactly the same way.

It has been tested with Django 2.2.*, 3.0.*, 3.1.* and their matching Python versions (3.5 to 3.8).

Features
--------

- Works like the built-in Django related fields
- Creates one table per relation, like ``ManyToManyField``, and not one big
  table linking anything to anything (django-generic-m2m_'s default approach)
- No need to modify nor monkey-patch the existing model classes that need to be
  linked
- Automatic reverse relations when an instance is added
- Related objects prefetching
- Through models support
- Deletion behaviour customization using signals
- Migrations support


Documentation
-------------

The documentation is hosted on readthedocs_. You'll find a quick start and
the description of all django-gm2m's advanced features.
